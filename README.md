# Academic Advisor Expert System Using Prolog

## Overview
The **Academic Advisor Expert System** is a knowledge-based application designed to assist students in course selection and academic planning. By leveraging First Order Logic (FOL) implemented in Prolog, this system provides personalized academic advice based on a student's major, completed courses, and academic requirements. This project simulates the role of an academic advisor, ensuring that students meet all prerequisites before enrolling in courses and guiding them through their academic journey.

## Key Features
- **Knowledge Base:**
  - Stores detailed information about courses, prerequisites, student details, and major requirements.
  - Allows dynamic updates to adapt to new academic information or program changes.

- **Inference Engine:**
  - Determines course eligibility by checking prerequisite completion and other academic requirements.
  - Provides logical conclusions regarding whether a student can enroll in a specific course.

- **Knowledge Acquisition and Learning Module:**
  - Facilitates the addition and updating of new courses, students, and completion records.
  - Supports modification or removal of existing knowledge, making the system highly flexible.

- **User Interface:**
  - Provides an interactive environment for querying the system about course eligibility.
  - Enables direct interaction with the knowledge base to add or update academic information.

- **Explanation Module:**
  - Offers detailed justifications for decisions made by the system, explaining the reasoning behind academic advice.
  - Clarifies unmet prerequisites or reasons why a course cannot be taken, ensuring transparency.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to streamline the academic advising process by automating tasks typically performed by human advisors. The system ensures that students follow a logical and structured academic path, preventing enrollment in courses without meeting necessary prerequisites, and guiding them toward successful completion of their major.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Prolog
- **Development Environment:** SWI-Prolog or any other Prolog interpreter

## Target Audience
- University students seeking advice on course selection.
- Academic advisors looking for a tool to assist in advising sessions.
- Educational institutions aiming to implement automated advising systems.

## Potential Applications
- Integration into university registration systems to automate course selection processes.
- Use as a teaching tool for demonstrating the application of expert systems in education.
- Adaptation for other domains requiring rule-based decision-making, such as career advising or program planning.

## Conclusion
The **Academic Advisor Expert System** showcases a practical application of artificial intelligence in education, demonstrating how expert systems can enhance decision-making processes. By providing clear, logical advice and explanations, this system aims to improve the academic experience for students and advisors alike.
